Viking Chess!

Goal (attackers): Surround the king (golden helmet) on all four sides

Goal (vikings): Get your king to one of the four corners and to safety

Rules:

+ Players can move horizontally and vertically as far as they please without hitting an obstacle
+ Sandwiching an enemy player with two of your players kills them! However, 
if you put one of your players in between two enemy players, your player will not die because the sandwich
must be initiated by the two surrounding players
+ The five darker squares serve as enemy squares for all players except the king, the king's goal is to get to one
of the corners. Therefore, you can use this square to sandwich other players between.
+ Once the king moves out of his dark square in the middle he cannot move back there, and this square
continues to be seen as an enemy square. However, if you have the chance you can pass over this middle square to the other side
